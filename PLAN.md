# PLAN — Phase 2: cost regression gate

Tier: T1 portfolio project. Branch: `feat/cost-regression-gate`.

Reframe (per Phase 2 kickoff, accepted): adk-tracegauge is no longer "a cost gauge" — it is
"the cost regression gate for ADK evals." Register one metric, get a per-invocation USD cost
with a PASS/FAIL threshold verdict inside `adk eval`, plus a CI gate that fails on statistically
significant cost regression.

## Corrections applied to Phase 1 (docs/audit/PHASE1_DIAGNOSIS.md)
- C1: D2 (stale google-adk pin / canary never run) downgraded P1→P2. Canary workflow committed
  2026-08-13 19:15 (Thu); cron is Mondays only; no Monday has elapsed as of 2026-08-14. VERIFIED:
  `git log -1 --format=%ci .github/workflows/pypi-canary.yml`.
- C2: D1 fix takes the threshold-redesign branch only, not the wrapper-exclusion branch.
- C3: Roadmap #7 (multi-provider pricing) promoted to top tier (this phase, W3).
- C4: NEW P0 — price-table correctness was never verified in Phase 1. W1, do first.
- C5: NEW P1 — unguarded private-API dependency on `EvaluationGenerator.convert_events_to_eval_invocations`.
- C6: OTel export ranks below gate work; deferred to Phase 3 per kickoff.

## Work items (sequenced — most share files, executed in dependency order on one branch)
- [x] W1 — Price correctness (P0, do first): schema audit, live pricing diff, tiering/cache-read/batch
      discount checks, fixes, staleness guard + rationale field, price-freshness.yml CI, tests.
      DONE 2026-08-14, commit 7107527. Findings: gemini-3.6-flash was priced at the wrong (post-promo)
      rate; 3 models missing entirely (gemini-3.7-flash, gemini-3.1-flash-lite, gemini-3.1-pro-preview);
      long-context tiering (>200k tokens) existed and was unmodeled for gemini-2.5-pro/gemini-3.1-pro-preview
      -- now modeled via resolve_model_for_call + synthetic "<model>-long-context" table entries;
      thoughts_token_count and tool_use_prompt_token_count were silently dropped (undercounting) -- thoughts
      now folded into output cost, tool_use_prompt refused (fails closed, no verified rate). Cache-read
      (0.1x) and batch-out-of-scope were re-verified and found already correct. STALE_THRESHOLD_DAYS
      180->90. price_as_of now in every rationale. 67->97 tests passing, 99% coverage. Full diff table and
      per-row verification tags in the session report (not yet written to docs/audit/PHASE2_REPORT.md --
      that's the final wrap-up item at the bottom of this file, still open).
- [ ] W2 — Threshold gate (fixes P0/D1): CostEfficiencyEvaluator redesigned to return real PASSED/FAILED,
      no path resolves to NOT_EVALUATED. Depends on W1 (price_as_of in rationale).
- [ ] W3 — Multi-provider pricing (promoted): Claude/GPT price entries, local models → cost 0.0 + PASSED,
      LiteLlm-prefix resolution, actionable unknown-model error. Depends on W1 schema + W2 PASSED framing.
- [ ] W4 — CI regression gate (the differentiator): `tracegauge check --baseline`, bootstrap CI,
      min-n refusal, synthetic fixture validation incl. measured false-positive rate. Depends on W1-W3.
- [ ] W6 — Hygiene: CI matrix 3.10-3.13, pin bump to admit 2.7.0 (after full suite green), GitHub topics,
      release backfill, dist/branch/assertion cleanup, oss-contrib branch sync, keras#23420 thread attempt.
- [ ] W5 — DX/adoption (last — documents everything above): eliminate/wrap private-API dependency (C5),
      README quickstart rewrite, examples/, badges, real passing+failing gate captures, CHANGELOG/CONTRIBUTING/
      issue template, trigger and document the 3 deferred misconfiguration errors.
- [ ] Verifier pass: independently re-run every test and every price figure.
- [ ] docs/audit/PHASE2_REPORT.md: what changed per item, before/after numbers, W1.2 price diff table,
      W2.4 actual `adk eval` output, W4.3(b) measured false-positive rate, numbered ROUTE-TO-GG list.

Deferred to Phase 3 (do not build now): OTel span-attribute export, trajectory analysis,
deterministic replay, HTML report, failure clustering, LLM-judge scoring.

Rules: zero-cost (local Ollama only, no paid API, never set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY); commit per work
item on this feature branch; no PyPI publish, no tag, no merge to main without reporting first.
